# Pyton-script_2022_dec_13
Checks number of rows in all files with specific name. Then pair them with a dictionary. After that based on connection it is divding number of rows with each other, puting,formating and saving it to an excelsheet.

This project was made to check and compare master data parameters between two systems.
Script is looping trough a list of files and storing the number of rows in an array.
Once done, based on a dictionary it compares the values and save the output to an excel file.
Once it is saved, it does some formatting then opens it, so a VBA code can trigger to autofit the columns.
